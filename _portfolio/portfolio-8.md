title: "Ambient Sensing: PM10 Web GIS Visualization"
excerpt: "<b>Keywords: Ambient Sensing, PM10 Monitoring, Web GIS</b><br/><br/><a href='/files/Report_web.pdf'>[Report]</a> <br/><br/>This project involved ambient sensing of PM10 air quality around the ETH Hönggerberg campus using a senseBox:edu. We developed an interactive Web GIS client (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) featuring ArcGIS Maps to visualize the 307 collected data points. The application was enhanced by integrating external Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) from opensensemap to validate our single measurements. The visualization successfully showed that PM10 values around the forest were lower than those near campus buildings. <br/><br/><img src='/images/web.png' width='500' height='300'>"
