This project focused on 3D Data Acquisition, Modeling, and Visualization of Archaeological Sites. The goal was to use advanced tools such as GNSS, terrestrial laser scanners, and drones to reconstruct historical landmarks, including Steinsberg Castle in Ardez and Fortezza Rohan in Susch, located in the Lower Engadin region of Switzerland. The team created high-quality 3D models for archaeological analysis and public exhibition.
