Unlike traditional methods that depend on specific instruments, our model relies solely on meteorological inputs, making it applicable on a global scale. We designed a robust data processing pipeline to integrate high-resolution ERA5 meteorological data with GNSS station observations.

Feature importance analysis revealed that specific humidity at lower atmospheric levels was the primary factor for accurate IWV predictions. <br/><br/><img src='/images/IWV.png' width='500' height='300'>"

In this project, we developed a machine learning model to predict Integrated Water Vapor (IWV) in the atmosphere. The model uses observations from 457 Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations, including geographical location, time, and several meteorological variables as input features. The reference IWV data comes from an enhanced IWV dataset, augmented with high spatiotemporal resolution meteorological information from the ERA5 reanalysis. Unlike traditional instrument-dependent methods, our model relies solely on meteorological variables, positional data, and temporal information, making it globally applicable.
