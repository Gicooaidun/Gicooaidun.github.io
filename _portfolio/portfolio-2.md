In this project, we automate the vectorization of historical Paris maps from the Atlas Municipal series (1866-1937) using deep neural networks. We focused on identifying and vectorizing building blocks, which are areas enclosed by streets or other boundaries. We implemented three models (U-Net, ResUnet, and SwinUnet) and evaluated their performance. SwinUnet showed the best accuracy and generalization.
