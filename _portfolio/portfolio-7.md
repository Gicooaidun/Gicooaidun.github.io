title: "Web GIS Usability Assessment: A Comparative User Study of St. Gallen and Obwalden Cantonal Services"
excerpt: "<b>Keywords: HCI, Web GIS, Usability, User-Centred Design (UCD)</b><br/><br/><a href='/files/Report_HCI.pdf'>[Report]</a> <br/><br/>This project was a comparative user study evaluating the <b>usability</b> of two Swiss cantonal Web GIS services: Obwalden and St. Gallen. Using a within-case design, five participants performed defined tasks (e.g., finding information, changing layers, measuring) to assess the systems’ efficiency and intuitive use. The findings demonstrated a clear preference for the St. Gallen Web GIS. This preference was linked to its more appealing design and enhanced efficiency, such as faster information retrieval enabled by its pop-up functionality. This small pilot study highlights the critical role of <b>User-Centred Design (UCD)</b> in effective Human Computer Interaction (HCI) for geospatial applications, successfully verifying three out of four proposed hypotheses regarding usability and performance. <br/><br/><img src='/images/hci.jpg' width='500' height='300'>"
