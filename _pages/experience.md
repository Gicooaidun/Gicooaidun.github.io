Work experience
======
* Sep 2025-Present: Machine Learning Intern - Weather Forecasting | Beijing Presky Technology Co., Ltd.
  * Developed a precipitation forecasting model integrating ERA5 reanalysis data (69 meteorological variables: 5
upper-air variables across 13 pressure levels + 4 surface variables) and ADTD lightning observations over China
(0.125Â° resolution). Implemented three deep learning architectures (UNeXt, ConvNeXt V2, SwinUNet) with
dual-head outputs (numerical regression + 21-class precipitation classification). Designed specialized loss functions
(WeightedPrecip, SSIM, Seesaw Loss) to handle sample imbalance and extreme precipitation events
  * Implemented and tested deep learning architectures (e.g., CNN, Transformer-based models) for short-term
precipitation and temperature forecasting.
