Work experience
======

* Sep 2025-Present: Machine Learning Intern - Weather Forecasting
  * Beijing Presky Technology Co., Ltd.
  * Developed a precipitation forecasting model integrating ERA5 reanalysis data (69 meteorological variables: 5
upper-air variables across 13 pressure levels + 4 surface variables) and ADTD lightning observations over China
(0.125Â° resolution). Implemented three deep learning architectures (UNeXt, ConvNeXt V2, SwinUNet) with
dual-head outputs (numerical regression + 21-class precipitation classification). Designed specialized loss functions
(WeightedPrecip, SSIM, Seesaw Loss) to handle sample imbalance and extreme precipitation events. 
  * Implemented and tested deep learning architectures (e.g., CNN, Transformer-based models) for short-term
precipitation and temperature forecasting.

* Mar 2022-May 2022: Research Intern
  * Hubei Provincial Academy of Eco-environmental Sciences
  * Collected, processed, and analyzed environmental monitoring data related to air and water quality across multiple
sampling stations. Assisted in preparing technical reports for environmental impact assessments (EIAs) and
pollution source investigations. Applied GIS tools to visualize pollution distribution patterns and supported spatial
analysis for regulatory planning.
