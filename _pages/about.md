Hi! I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in Geomatics at [ETH Zurich](https://baug.ethz.ch/en/)'s Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, with an expected graduation in 2025. I earned my bachelor’s degree in Geographical Information Science from Wuhan University in 2022. 

My research interests are primarily focused on two areas:
1. **Applying Machine Learning and Computer Vision to Understand Spatiotemporal Changes:** I am deeply interested in leveraging **machine learning** models and **computer vision** techniques to extract and analyze spatial information from real-world imagery datasets (including **remote sensing datasets** and digital map datasets). My goal is to develop innovative deep learning models that can capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies, enabling more accurate forecasting and understanding of changes in urban environments.
2. **Analyzing Spatiotemporal Variations in urban areas**: I am equally passionate about exploring and modeling the dynamics of urban areas through the lens of **spatiotemporal data analysis**. By discovering, collecting, and integrating heterogeneous data sources, I aim to uncover insights into urban development, movement patterns, and how cities evolve over time. My research in this area also includes mobility analysis to study how human activity interacts with the built environment.

Outside of my academic work, I enjoy hiking, listening to classical music, reading, and watching movies, which provide a refreshing balance to my research activities.
