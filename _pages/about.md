Hi! I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in Geomatics at [ETH Zurich](https://baug.ethz.ch/en/)'s Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, with an expected graduation in 2025. I earned my bachelor’s degree in Geographical Information Science from Wuhan University in 2022. 

My research interests are primarily focused on two areas:
1. **Leveraging Artificial Intelligence techniques to Solve Challenges in Complex Urban Systems:** I focus on applying AI techniques, including **machine learning** and **computer vision**, to analyze spatial and temporal data from real-world datasets. My goal is to address challenges in **complex urban systems** by optimizing infrastructure, mitigating environmental impacts, and supporting sustainable development. Through AI-driven models and advanced tools like photogrammetry and remote sensing, I aim to develop innovative solutions for building smarter, more adaptive, and resilient cities.
2. **Analyzing Spatiotemporal Variations in urban areas**: I am equally passionate about exploring and modeling the dynamics of urban areas through the lens of **spatiotemporal data analysis**. By discovering, collecting, and integrating heterogeneous data sources, I aim to uncover insights into urban development, movement patterns, and how cities evolve over time. My research in this area also includes mobility analysis to study how human activity interacts with the built environment.

Outside of my academic work, I enjoy hiking, listening to classical music, reading, and watching movies, which provide a refreshing balance to my research activities.
