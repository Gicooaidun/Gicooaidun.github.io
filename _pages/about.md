Hi! I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in Geomatics at [ETH Zurich](https://baug.ethz.ch/en/)'s Department of Civil, Environmental and Geomatic Engineering, with an expected graduation in 2025. I earned my bachelor’s degree in Geographical Information Science from Wuhan University in 2022. 

My research interests primarily focus on two areas:
1. **Leveraging Artificial Intelligence techniques to Tackle Global Challenges:** I focus on applying artificial intelligence techniques——to analyze large-scale spatial and temporal datasets derived from satellite imagery and historical map. My goal is to contribute to the monitoring and understanding of environmental changes. Through AI-driven models and advanced tools like remote sensing, I aim to develop innovative solutions for building smarter, more adaptive, and resilient cities.
2. **Analyzing Spatiotemporal Variations in urban areas:** I am also deeply interested in exploring and modeling the dynamics of urban areas through spatiotemporal data analysis. By discovering, collecting, and integrating heterogeneous data sources, I aim to uncover insights into urban development, human mobility patterns, and the long-term evolution of cities. 

Outside of my academic work, I enjoy hiking, listening to classical music, reading, and watching movies, which provide a refreshing balance to my research activities.
